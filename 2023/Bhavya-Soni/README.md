Hey everyone, I am Bhavya from India. I have been programming with Python language for the last 4+ years. I started programming with competative coding and backend development then learned new technologies like machine learning and deep learning. I am very excited to be a part of an open source project as there are always new things to learn from peers and mentors, and also I want to contribute my knowledge to the open source community.
I want to contribute to wagtail as it is widely used by the organizations. Specifically, I want to contribute to the project idea `RFC 72: Background workers`. As I have worked with message queuing(RabbitMQ and celery), it will be great to implement the technology in wagtail. It will improve the performance of the product.
To be part of an open source community itself will be an achievement for any individual and to be part of Wagtail open source community via GSoC platform adds more value and great leaning experience.
